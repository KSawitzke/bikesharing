# Bikesharing

## Overview

Kate wants to implement a new bikesharing business in Des Moines, Iowa. To help her with her investor's meeting pitch, I used citibike data from New York City to build a Tableau Story for her to help present her idea.

## Results

The visualizations corresponding to the following results can be found on this [dashboard.](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kyle7879/viz/Module14_16581736380860/NYCStory?publish=yes)

 - The first and second page of the story shows a heatmap with the top locations for starting and ending a trip in NYC
 - The third page shows the trip breakdown by gender
 - The fourth page shows the peak hours within a summer month, August
 - Fifth is Checkout times, followed by a closer look at checkout times by gender
 - Sixth and seventh are the trips by weekday per-hour, then that same data by gender
 - Finally, we see a heat map of the number of trips taken each day of the week by gender and usertype
 
## Summary

These final three are key to Kate's investor pitch. They all clearly show that the peak hours of use are during normal commuting hours for standard work hours. This extends further in the weekday trips by subscriber, where we see the people who subscribe tend to use the bikes with increased frequency, particularly during the work week. This is key in selling the idea in Des Moines for Kate, she will have to show there is a commuter population that can be targeted for the new bikeshare program.

Two additional visualizations that would be useful are average length of trip by hour of week day and average age of rides by gender and week day. If additional data from Des Moines was available, perhaps public transit use numbers, availibility of bike lanes, concentration of downtown work places, etc. etc. some sort of idea could be painted for the investors the size of a potential consumer base for this project in Iowa's capital.
